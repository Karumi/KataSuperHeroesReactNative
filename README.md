- We are here to practice testing in React Native.
- We are going to use [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) to create our App.
- We are going to use [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- We are going to use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to test our code and replace production code with [Test Doubles](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html).
- We are going to practice pair programming.

## Getting started

This repository contains a ReactNative application to show Super Heroes information:

This Application is based on two screens:

* ``MainScreen`` showing a list of super heroes with name, photo and a special badge if is part of the Avengers Team.

* ``SuperHeroDetailScreen`` showing detailed information about a super hero like his or her name, photo and description.

The application architecture, dependencies and configuration is ready to just start writing tests. In this project you'll find  ``Jest`` configured to be able to replace production code with test doubles easily and to be able to interact with the application user interface from the component viewpoint.

## Tasks

Your task as Software Engineer is to **write all the tests** needed to check if the app is working as expected. 

**This repository is ready to build the application, pass the checkstyle and your tests in Travis-CI environments.**

Our recommendation for this exercise is:

  * Before starting
    1. Fork this repository.
    2. Checkout `kata-super-heroes` branch.
    3. Execute the application, explore it manually and make yourself familiar with the code.
    4. Execute `yarn test` and watch the only test it contains pass.

  * To help you get started, these are some test cases already written. Take a look at the ``__tests__`` folders.

## Considerations

* If you get stuck, `master` branch contains already solved tests for the whole app.

* You will find some utilities around the code to help you test the app properly.
  
## Extra Tasks

If you've covered all the application functionality using automated tests try to continue with the following tasks:

* Add a pull to refresh mechanism to the main screen and test it.
* Modify ``SuperHeroDetailScreen`` to handle an error case where the name of the super hero used to start this activity does not exist and show a message if this happens.
* Modify the project to handle connection errors and show a message to the user to indicate something went wrong.
